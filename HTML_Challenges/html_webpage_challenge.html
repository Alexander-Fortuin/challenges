          <p>That the very people who championed the technology to which we are addicted are now banding together
            to warn parents about the monster they’ve created is perhaps a  sign that more people are starting to
             question tech’s outsized role in our lives. But it feels a bit farfetched that an ad campaign, no matter
              how well-intentioned, can really help curtail our society’s addiction–especially when kids these days are
               being introduced to screens at such a young age. In her book, <i>The Art of Screen Time</i> Anya Kamenetz
                cited a 2011 survey of 9,000 preschoolers (3- to 5-year-olds) that found that young kids spend about four
                 hours a day in the company of (all types of) screens.</p>

          <p>To find out what parents think about their kids’ use of tech, Fast Company surveyed nearly 400 parents.
            We tried to look at the issue from all angles, from the amount of screen time kids get to have, to the types
              of devices kids use, to parents’ regrets about their kids use of technology, to the benefits that technology can
              provide to families. We also asked parents how they feel about witnessing their own tech addiction reflected in their
               kids’ behavior. Those were, perhaps, the most telling answers of all.</p>

          <p>The parents who answered our survey hail from all over the U.S. (and a few other countries). Their professions
             span many industries, including marketing, public relations, education, finance, therapy, video production, law,
              medicine, and business. Most participants have one or two children, ranging from 7 months to 18 years old. The majority
               of participants’ kids are between 3 and 11 years old; in other words, these parents are in the thick of parenting.</p>

           <p>Obviously, this self-selected group of <i>Fast Company</i> readers isn’t a conclusive sample–but,
              along with expert research, these parents’ insights help provide a snapshot of the worries that burden parents in our tech-dependent era.<p>
