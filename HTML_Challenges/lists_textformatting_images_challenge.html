                  <p>
                    As you can see in the image above the chicken-schnitzel is cooked through
                    and is brown on both sides

                    <b>To Summarise</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tenderise the chicken, then coat it in flour, then the egg mixture.
                    Cover the chicken in breadcrumbs immediately after the egg mixture.
                    Now fry the chicken in the pan with oil until it is brown on both
                    sides and the chicken is cooked through,
                    or bake in the oven for 15 - 20 minutes at 180 degrees.
