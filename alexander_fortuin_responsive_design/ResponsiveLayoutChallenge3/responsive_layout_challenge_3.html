          <h3>The Big Bang Theory</h3>
          <p>
          The Big Bang Theory is an American television sitcom created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, both of whom serve as executive producers on the series, along with Steven Molaro. All three also serve as head writers. In March 2017, the series was renewed for two additional seasons, bringing its total to twelve, and running through the 2018–19 television season. The eleventh season premiered on September 25, 2017.</p>
          <p>
          The show is primarily centered on five characters living in Pasadena, California: Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper, both physicists at Caltech, who share an apartment; Penny, a waitress and aspiring actress who later becomes a pharmaceutical representative and who lives across the hall; and Leonard and Sheldon's similarly geeky and socially awkward friends and co-workers, aerospace engineer Howard Wolowitz and astrophysicist Raj Koothrappali. The geekiness and intellect of the four men are contrasted for comic effect with Penny's social skills and common sense.</p>

          <h3>The Originals</h3>
          <p>
            The Originals is a spin-off from The Vampire Diaries which centers around the Mikaelson siblings, Klaus (Joseph Morgan), Elijah (Daniel Gillies), and Rebekah (Claire Holt). The Mikealson family is called "the Originals" as they are the first vampires to ever exist. Niklaus "Klaus" Mikaelson is the central character of the series. He is a descendant of a vampire and a werewolf which led him to become a Hybrid in the prequel series The Vampire Diaries. The backdoor pilot, which aired on April 25, 2013, also revealed that the werewolf Hayley (Phoebe Tonkin) is pregnant with Klaus's child and would, therefore, join the cast. The show begins with the original siblings returning to the city of New Orleans for the first time since 1919. Having originally built the city, they had been forced to flee from their vengeful father. In their absence, Klaus's protégé, Marcel (Charles Michael Davis), took charge of the city. Klaus resolves that they must take down Marcel and get back the city that once belonged to them. While doing that they must also protect their city from a war brewing between vampires, werewolves and witches. Over time new and old friendships are formed, love is in the air, death surrounds them and most of all they learn more about their own family past. The first season describes how Klaus's mystical child is going to be born and speaks of the threats that the family together must keep away from her. The second season deals with the return of Klaus' parents, and the arrival of an aunt who threatens the baby's life. The third season shows the Mikealsons facing a prophecy that speaks of their downfall, and the first sired vampires who've wanted revenge for a millennium. The fourth season jumps ahead five years, with the Mikaelsons returning to NOLA, and a new, powerful, and ruthless menace set on destroying anything in its path.
